<div style="text-align: justify;">
The research on detonation can be seperated into several regimes using the pressure and density diagram of Schmitt and Bulter $^{[1]}$. Gas phase detonation focus mainly on low pressure regime with perfect gas assumption while solid explosive or energetic materials lie on high pressure regime. Recently, the research on two-phase RDE partly falls in the regime of liquid phase detonation. However, the regime of gas with elevated pressure seems rarely explored in detonation research. It has been proved that the perfect gas based model fails to capture the detonation speed and cellular structure regularity at elevated pressure $^{[1-2]}$.

## 1. Detonation initiation
<div style="text-align: justify;">
A critical decay rate model was derived to study the direct detonation initiation at elevated initial pressure. Compared to the perfect gas based model of Eckett et al. $^{[3]}$, the finite molecular volume results in easier initiation while the inter-molecular interaction results in more difficult initiation.

## 2. Detonation structure
<div style="text-align: justify;">
The detonation speed, reaction zone structure of steady detonation wave were studied for both perfect gas and real gas models. Larger detonation speed was obtained for real gas model which agrees better with experimental data. The reaction zone structure depends on various aspects in the real gas model. In addition, uncertainty quantification was performed for parameters in real gas model.

## 3. Detonation stability
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Linear and non-linear stability analysis was performed for 1D detonation for Noble-Abel gas. The finite molecular volume effect stabilizes detonation except for newtonian and weak heat release regimes. Linear stability solutions agree well with numerical simulations. (more is coming)
