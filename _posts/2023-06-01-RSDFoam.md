RSDFoam is a solver for <font color=red>R</font>eal gas <font color=red>S</font>hock and <font color=red>D</font>etonation simulation based on Open<font color=red>FOAM</font>. The present solver was based on <font color=red>the reactive Euler equations</font>. It has considered the nonidealities in the equation of state, thermodynamic functions and mass action law brought about by the interaction between the fluid particles and by their finite volume. 

## Implementation
RSDFoam was a connection between Cantera and blastFoam. A number of real gas models based on cubic equation of state were implemented by the authors in Cantera 2.4. The solver also utilize the the efficient chemistry solver (CVODE) and flexible input formats in Cantera. BlastFoam offers a number of CFD capabilities including high-order flux evaluation, time integration, etc.

## Validation
RSDFoam has been thoroughly validated against analytical solutions, previous numerical simulation results and experimental data. The satisfactory agreement demonstrates the accuracy and robustness of the solver for real gas based shock and detonation simulation.
