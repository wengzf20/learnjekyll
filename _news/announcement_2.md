This work investigated detonation stability at elevated pressure via linear stability analysis and numerical simulation. The effect of finite molecular volume neglected in perfect gas was accounted for with real gas models based on the Noble-Abel equation of state. It was found to generally stabilize the pulsating detonation but the destabilization effect can also be found in the limit of weak heat release and in the Newtonian limit. The linear stability analysis shows satisfactory consistencies with numerical simulation.

A new neutral stability boundary was proposed in the isentropic coefficient - covolume plane, which contributes to better understanding on the variation of cellular structure regularity seen in previous simulations even though the present analysis was carried out for a lower dimension.
