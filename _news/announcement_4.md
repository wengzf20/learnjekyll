We have built a long spiral tube facility to study the near-limit detonation in near stoichiometric propane-oxygen mixtures. A number of methods were adopted by [Zhaoyuan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhaoyuan-Huang-3) to achieve accurate measurement on the detonation dynamics, including improvements in the tube length, framing rate and resolution, image processing methods, continuous wavelet analysis. We observed stable, stuttering, and galloping regimes of detonation propagation in the experiments and detailed analysis were performed.

Pathological detonation is detonation with the propagation velocity higher than the classical Chapman-Jouguet velocity. Such a behavior has been experimentally observed in low-pressure hydrogen-chlorine mixtures and important discrepancies were reported between the experimental and the theoretical velocities. [Zituo](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zituo-Chen) has investigated these discrepancies by considering the uncertainty in reaction model and the thermal non-equilibrium effect. The former was studied with Monte Carlo sampling while the latter effect was studied with a multi-temperature, thermal non-equilibrium model.
