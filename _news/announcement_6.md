<p style="text-align: justify;">
Supercritical carbon dioxide power cycle has received substantial attention in recent years due to its attractive features of compactness, low capital cost, high thermal efficiency and near zero CO$_{2}$ emissions. We numerically studied the laminar flame speed of oxy-syngas and oxy-methane mixtures under relevant conditions with an in-house solver. The relative errors / uncertainties induced by using the ideal gas model and by employing different mechanisms were reported in this work.
