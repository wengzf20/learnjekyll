This work investigated the propagation of spherical flame at high pressure conditions at which the effect of finite molecular volume is non-negligible. By using asymptotic analysis and numerical simulation, we demonstrated that the non-ideal effect leads to higher flame speed at quasi-steady state and to lower Markstein number compared to the perfect gas based solutions. Strategies for high-pressure laminar flame speed extrapolation were discussed and the relative uncertainty related to the finite volume effect is of 20-45% over the total uncertainty for pressures in the range 1-2.5 MPa, indicating that effect of finite molecular volume cannot be neglected to determine the laminar flame speed under such pressure conditions.
